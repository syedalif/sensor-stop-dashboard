In the United States, the prevalence of car accidents is a pressing concern, with an estimated
38,824 deaths and 4.4 million injuries reported in 2019 alone, according to the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The human toll of these incidents is 
staggering, leaving families shattered and communities grappling with the aftermath.

Our mission is rooted in a commitment to curb this alarming trend. 
Through a project leveraging technology, we aim to address the root causes of accidents
by implementing a camera system attached to stop signs. This innovative approach seeks to
capture instances of reckless driving and law violations, ultimately acting as a deterrent 
to reduce accidents and save lives. By combining surveillance with proactive intervention, 
our objective is to contribute to a safer road environment for everyone. Together, let's 
pave the way for a future where preventable accidents are minimized, and our roads become safer for all.
